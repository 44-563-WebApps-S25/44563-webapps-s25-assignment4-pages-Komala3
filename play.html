   <h3>SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.</h3>
   <p class="stage-direction">Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black</p>
    <h4 CLASS="COUNTESS">COUNTESS</h4>
   <p class="speech"> In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.</p>
    <h4 class="BERTRAM">BERTRAM</h4>
   <p CLASS="speech"> And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
    anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
    whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</p>
    <h4 class="LAFEU">LAFEU</h4>
    <p CLASS="speech">You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
    sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
    good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
    worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
    than lack it where there is such abundance.</p>
    <h4 class="COUNTESS">COUNTESS</h4>
    <p CLASS="speech">What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?</p>
    <h4 class="LAFEU">LAFEU</h4>
   <p CLASS="speech"> He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
    practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
    finds no other advantage in the process but only the
    losing of hope by time.</p>
    <h4 class="COUNTESS">COUNTESS</h4>
    <p CLASS="speech">This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
    'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
    almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
    far, would have made nature immortal, and death
    should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
    king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
    the death of the king's disease.</p>
    <h4 class="LAFEU">LAFEU</h4>
    <p class="speech">How called you the man you speak of, madam?</p>
    <h4 class="COUNTESS">COUNTESS</h4>
    <p class="speech">He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
    his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</p>
    <h4 class="LAFEU">LAFEU</h4>
    <p class="speechH">He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
    lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
    was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
    could be set up against mortality.</p>
